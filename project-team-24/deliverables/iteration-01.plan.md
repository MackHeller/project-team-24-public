TODO

#### Roles & responsibilities TODO

Describe the different roles (e.g. developers, communication facilitator,
proof-reader, etc.) on the team, and the responsibilities associated with each role.

#### Events

Please describe the meetings you planning to have:
 * When and where? In-person or online?
 * What's the purpose of each meeting?

 Meeting 1:
 - Thursday Oct 6th 2016
 - The meeting took place in person in room 3200 BA.
 - The purpose of the meeting was to discuss our project options. Each group member put forward a
 list of ideas. We then analysed the positives and negatives or each idea (giving each one a final score).

#### Artifacts

Please describe the artifacts that you will produce in order to organize and keep track of your team's progress.
For example:
 * To-do lists, burndown chart, schedule, etc.
 * If you include charts/diagrams, make sure to explain what they represent.
 * If you're maintaining a to-do list, make sure to mention which tool you're using, how you are prioritizing items and how items get assigned to team members.

 - This was our Google doc for brainstorming projects:

## Product

Goals and tasks:

 * Describe your goals for this iteration and the tasks that you will have to complete in order to achieve these goals.
 * When listing goals/tasks, order the items from most to least important.
 * Feel free (but not obligated) to specify some/all tasks as user stories.

Artifacts

 * Describe the artifacts (diagrams, interactive mock-ups, wireframes, actual code, etc.)
   that you are planning to produce by the end of (and during) this iteration.
 * Be precise.
   For example: "Build the website" is not precise at all, but "Build a static home page and upload it somewhere, so that it is publicly accessible" is much clearer.
