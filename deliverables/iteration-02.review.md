## Process - Reflection

One change that we made to our goals is that we didn't implement accounts. This would have required us to set up a database and we chose to prioritize other features instead. Instead we saved our levels locally as JSON files. 

We also focused too much on backend work that wasn't relivent to our iteration-2 demo. While all the work we did needed to get done eventually, we didn't have the ablility to properly demo all of our progress. 

## Product - Review
