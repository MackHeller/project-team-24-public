# YOUR PRODUCT/TEAM NAME

## Iteration 1

 * Start date: Thursday Oct 26st 2016
 * End date: Wednesday Nov 15 2016

## Process

Introduction
This is a summary of the planning group 24 did during the second iteration. We had many additional
discussions on Slack; a social network application. We planned out our implementation for the prototype and distributed roles for working on the prototype

#### Roles & responsibilities

Maria will work together drag and drop & Collision
 - Can drag over other objects, canâ€™t place over them
 - Need to allow wires to overlap but not gates
 - Need to be able to detect if wire is connected (maybe simple click)
 - Use placeholder game objects for now, Freddy will hook up later
 - Be able to delete objects
 
Freddy will write the code for levels, wire, gate, and simulation backend logic
 
Accounts (Mack)
 - Probably use a DB for usernames, passwords, and a set of map IDs that they can edit and map IDs which they cannot or something more efficient of the sort to maintain permission
 - Need to be able to log in and out
 
Integration (Dylan)
 - Put together the front-end (drag and drop with filler objects right now) and the back-end (gate logic)


#### Events

We continue following our previous plan: we will have have, at minimum, one face-to-face meeting weekly and to make use of Slack on a consistent basis. We expect face-to-face meetings to either be on Thursday 10-11AM or Friday 2-3PM depending on team availability.
If a face-to-face meeting is not possible, then an online meeting will be held in the form of a group call. These backup meetings will be held during the weekend at a time that is convenient for all group members.

In general, the purpose of these meetings is to go over what has been done and assign general tasks to be completed by the next meeting time. The meetings will also be a knowledge sharing period where team members can help solve any issues of concern other members are having. Smaller decisions will be handled in the group chat over Slack.
 

#### Artifacts

Please describe the artifacts that you will produce in order to organize and keep track of your team's progress.
For example:
 * To-do lists, burndown chart, schedule, etc.
 * If you include charts/diagrams, make sure to explain what they represent.
 * If you're maintaining a to-do list, make sure to mention which tool you're using, how you are prioritizing items and how items get assigned to team members.

 


## Product

Goals and tasks:

 * Describe your goals for this iteration and the tasks that you will have to complete in order to achieve these goals.
 * When listing goals/tasks, order the items from most to least important.
 * Feel free (but not obligated) to specify some/all tasks as user stories.

Artifacts

 * Describe the artifacts (diagrams, interactive mock-ups, wireframes, actual code, etc.)
   that you are planning to produce by the end of (and during) this iteration.
 * Be precise.
   For example: "Build the website" is not precise at all, but "Build a static home page and upload it somewhere, so that it is publicly accessible" is much clearer.
   
 * Document an outline of the student of our project. We will outline details answers to questions like what will the user flow be? How will the user interact with our project?
 * We will create the initial basic objects required for our program to functions, these include but are not limited to: levels, inputTriggers, outputTriggers, logic objects, file readers/writers
 * We will create a document listing the tasks assigned to each person
