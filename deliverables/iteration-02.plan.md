# YOUR PRODUCT/TEAM NAME

## Iteration 1

 * Start date: Thursday Oct 26st 2016
 * End date: 

## Process

Introduction
This is a summary of the planning group 24 did during the second iteration. We had many additional
discussions on Slack; a social network application.

#### Roles & responsibilities




#### Events

Please describe the meetings you planning to have:
 * When and where? In-person or online?
 * What's the purpose of each meeting?

The current plan regarding events is to have, at minimum, one face-to-face meeting weekly and to make use of Slack on a consistent basis. If a face-to-face meeting is not possible, then an online meeting will be held in the form of a group call. In general, the purpose of these meetings is to go over what has been done and assign general tasks to be completed by the next meeting time. The meetings will also be a knowledge sharing period where team members can help solve any issues of concern other members are having. Smaller decisions will be handled in the group chat over Slack.
 

#### Artifacts

Please describe the artifacts that you will produce in order to organize and keep track of your team's progress.
For example:
 * To-do lists, burndown chart, schedule, etc.
 * If you include charts/diagrams, make sure to explain what they represent.
 * If you're maintaining a to-do list, make sure to mention which tool you're using, how you are prioritizing items and how items get assigned to team members.

 


## Product

Goals and tasks:

 * Describe your goals for this iteration and the tasks that you will have to complete in order to achieve these goals.
 * When listing goals/tasks, order the items from most to least important.
 * Feel free (but not obligated) to specify some/all tasks as user stories.

Artifacts

 * Describe the artifacts (diagrams, interactive mock-ups, wireframes, actual code, etc.)
   that you are planning to produce by the end of (and during) this iteration.
 * Be precise.
   For example: "Build the website" is not precise at all, but "Build a static home page and upload it somewhere, so that it is publicly accessible" is much clearer.
