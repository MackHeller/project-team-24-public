 * Short (1 min' read max)
 * Be concrete - Are you planning to build a website, mobile app,
   browser extension, command-line app, etc.?
 * Be clear about what the problem that your product solves (or the need that it answers).
 * Focus on *what* your product does, and avoid discussing *how* you're going to implement it.
   For example: This is not the time or the place to talk about which programming language and/or framework you are planning to use.
 * Feel free (and very much encouraged) to include useful diagrams and/or links

CSC258, Computer Organization, is often considered the most difficult course for second year University of Toronto computer science students. We are building a tool to assist students in learning about computer organization, with a focus on the material in the University of Toronto's CSC258 course. We want it to allow users to freely build their own circuits and modules as well as go through premade circuit puzzle levels which involve building increasingly complex circuits, starting from basic gates and moving to finite state machines and beyond, reflective of CSC258 material. At the same time, our tool should provide an interface for instructors to build customized circuit puzzles to easily upload and distribute.

The tool will most likely be multiplatform (purely for context: we plan to build it in Unity so it can export to every platform) but optimized for Web and Mobile.

We believe our tool can be useful for anybody who wishes to learn Computer Organization and related material. However, we plan to specifically target:
 - Students for CSC258 (Computer Organization) and similar courses. They are the demographic most likely to learn the material that the tool will educate them on and thus the people we believe will be most likely to use the tool.
 - Instructors for CSC258 (Computer Organization) and similar courses. We believe that they will enjoy the ability to create customizable yet easily usable puzzles for their studente and and potentially promote the tool to their students as well.


#### Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem?

YOUR ANSWER GOES HERE ...

 * Short (3 min' read max)
 * Essentially, we want you to "connect the dots" for us - Why does your product (as described in your answer to Q1) fits the needs of your users (as described in your answer to Q2)?
 * Highlight significant prodcut decisions that you've made:
    * Mention which alternatives you were considering.
    * Explain why the option you decided on makes the most sense for your product/users.

A commonly used circuit builder which does not have this difference is LogiSim(http://www.cburch.com/logisim/). You can find multiple other tools for practicing circuit creation (https://www.google.ca/#q=online+circuit+builder). However, many of these other tools heavily emphasize electrical properties, which is not mentioned beyond the first week in CSC258 at UofT.
The primary issues are twofold with other tools: 
Firstly, they provide too many options and are unfriendly to beginners who are taking an introductory circuit-building and hardware course such as CSC258. 
Secondly, most of them do not focus on maintaining engagement and often assume that the user will be motivated to use them. This is untrue for many students, who we believe will gain alot from having external motivators such as levelling up, getting points, and in general progression through the puzzle 'levels'.
We solve both of these issues by focusing on the niche audience which requires a user-friendly tool for introductory students to remotely learn the often fast-paced material.
