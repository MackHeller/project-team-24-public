# Logic Circuit Game

CSC258, Computer Organization, is often considered the most difficult course for second year University of Toronto computer science students. We are building a tool to assist students in learning about computer organization, with a focus on the material of CSC258. It will allow users to freely build their own circuits and modules as well as go through premade circuit puzzle levels which involve building increasingly complex circuits, starting from basic gates and moving to finite state machines and beyond, reflective of CSC258 material. At the same time, our tool will provide an interface for instructors to build customized circuit puzzles to easily upload and distribute. The tool will be built in Unity, so it will be multiplatform, but optimized for Web and Mobile. 
   
We believe our tool can be useful for anybody who wishes to learn Computer Organization and related material. However, we plan to specifically target:
* Students for CSC258 and similar courses. They are the demographic most likely to learn the material that the tool will educate them on and thus the people we believe will be most likely to use the tool.
* Instructors of those students. We believe that they will appreciate having the ability to easily create customizable problem sets for their students which will enable students to succeed. We hope this will also help with promoting the use of our product by encouraging or requiring its use within their class.

A commonly used circuit builder which does not have the game-like features is [LogiSim](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/).

You can find [multiple other tools for practicing circuit creation on Google](https://www.google.ca/#q=online+circuit+builder) however many of these other tools heavily emphasize electrical properties, which is not mentioned beyond the first week in CSC258.

There are two primary issues with other tools: 
* They provide too many options and are unfriendly to beginners who are taking an introductory circuit-building and hardware course. 
* Most of them do not focus on maintaining engagement and often assume that the user will be motivated to use them. This is untrue for many students, who we believe will gain alot from having external motivators such as leveling up, getting points, and in general progression through the puzzle 'levels'.

We solve both of these issues by focusing on providing to our audience a user-friendly tool with captivating game like features for students to learn the often fast-paced material.
