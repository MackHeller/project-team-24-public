## Process


#### Roles & responsibilities

Initial Roles:

We decided that everyone will be a general developer and contribute to all aspects of the project. Some of us have prior experience in certain areas of development and will be designated as a lead in that role. A role lead will primarily work on their area of expertise and also act as a go-to person if anybody on the team has questions about the area they're leading.

Dylan: Has the most front end experience in our team, so his role within the team will be leading the front-end development.

Mack: Mack has prior experience in QA testing and will be the quality assurance specialist of the team. His task will be to ensure the product is thoroughly tested and working as intended.

Freddy: Will focus on gamification and level design. The primary goal of this project is education, but a large part of effective education is engagement; it is for this purpose that Freddy will take the lead in creating engaging and interesting level designs and game features.

Maria and Herman: Maria and Herman will be the dedicated developers for this project. Focusing mainly on the core functionality of the project and moving into other areas when needed.

#### Events

The current plan regarding events is to have, at minimum, one face-to-face meeting weekly and to make use of Slack on a consistent basis. If a face-to-face meeting is not possible, then an online meeting will be held in the form of a group call. In general, the purpose of these meetings is to go over what has been done and assign general tasks to be completed by the next meeting time. The meetings will also be a knowledge sharing period where team members can help solve any issues of concern other members are having. Smaller decisions will be handled in the group chat over Slack.
 
#### Artifacts

Our team will make use of several applications for team organization and task distribution. For team organization we will make use of Slack; decisions made over Slack will likely be on topics not concerning direct implementation  but more so on scheduling and other team issues. General brainstorming and info aggregation will be handled by the use of google docs.  The group editing allowed by google docs will also assist during weekly meetings if we unable to meet face-to-face. for assigning tasks  and tracking progress we will make use of a to-do list, primarily over the tool Trello. The Trello interface is composed of a project backlog, a blocked task list, an in-progress task list, tasks to be tested, tasks which are completed, and lastly tasks which have been merged and pushed. The assignment of these tasks, and their associated priority, will be carried out during either the group meetings or over Slack.

## Product

Goals and tasks:

* Describe your goals for this iteration and the tasks that you will have to complete in order to achieve these goals.
* When listing goals/tasks, order the items from most to least important.
* Feel free (but not obligated) to specify some/all tasks as user stories.

Artifacts

* Describe the artifacts (diagrams, interactive mock-ups, wireframes, actual code, etc.) that you are planning to produce by the end of (and during) this iteration.
* Be precise. For example: "Build the website" is not precise at all, but "Build a static home page and upload it somewhere, so that it is publicly accessible" is much clearer.
