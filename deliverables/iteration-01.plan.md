# Team 24

## Iteration 1

 * Start date: Thursday Oct 6th 2016
 * End date: Friday Oct 21st 2016

## Process

### Roles & responsibilities

We decided that everyone will be a general developer and contribute to all aspects of the project. Some of us have prior experience in certain areas of development and will be designated as a lead in that role. A role lead will primarily work on their area of expertise and also act as a go-to person if anybody on the team has questions about the area they're leading.

**Dylan** has the most front end experience in our team, so his role within the team will be leading the front-end development.

**Mack** has prior experience in QA testing and will be the quality assurance specialist of the team. His task will be to ensure the product is thoroughly tested and working as intended.

**Freddy** will focus on gamification and level design. The primary goal of this project is education, but a large part of effective education is engagement; it is for this purpose that Freddy will take the lead in creating engaging and interesting level designs and game features.

**Maria and Herman** will be the general developers for this project. Focusing mainly on the core functionality of the project and moving into other areas when needed.

### Events

The current plan regarding events is to have, at minimum, one face-to-face meeting weekly and to make use of Slack on a consistent basis. If a face-to-face meeting is not possible, then an online meeting will be held in the form of a group call. In general, the purpose of these meetings is to go over what has been done and assign general tasks to be completed by the next meeting time. The meetings will also be a knowledge sharing period where team members can help solve any issues of concern other members are having. Smaller decisions will be handled in the group chat over Slack.
 
### Artifacts

Our team will make use of several applications for team organization and task distribution. For team organization we will make use of Slack; decisions made over Slack will likely be on topics not concerning direct implementation but more so on scheduling and other team issues. General brainstorming and info aggregation will be handled by the use of google docs. The group editing allowed by Google docs will also assist during weekly meetings if we unable to meet face-to-face. For assigning tasks and tracking progress we will make use of the project management tool Trello. We'll break down our goals into small, granular tasks and create a card for each in Trello. Then each card will be categorized into the following lists: backlog, blocked, in-progress, undergoing testing, completed, and merged/pushed. The assignment of these tasks, and their associated priority, will be carried out during either the group meetings or over Slack.

## Product

### Goals and Tasks

Our goals (and their associated tasks) for this iteration are as follows, listed from most to least important:

* Brainstorm various project ideas. For each of them we will:
  * Identify a user problem
  * Describe a suitable solution
  * Specify the target audience
* Pick one of our brainstormed ideas. We need to answer the following questions for each in order to make our decision:
  * Is it practical?
  * Is it feasible given our time constraint?
  * Will our target audience have a reason to use our product?
  * Do we actually want to build this?
* Slides for chosen idea presentation in tutorial. This will involve describing:
  * The problem we chose
  * The solution we came up with
  * Our target audience
  * How we hope to go about completing our project (workflow)
  * Our roles and responsibilities outlined in an earlier section
* Get an idea for how we will implement our project. We need to decide on the following:
  * A target platform
  * Our tech stack
* Get all group members up to speed with our chosen tech stack

### Artifacts

* Document outlining our list of ideas including the problem, solution and target audience for each
* Document outlining our chosen idea with more in depth consideration for that idea
* Slides for our chosen idea presentation in tutorial
