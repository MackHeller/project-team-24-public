# YOUR PRODUCT/TEAM NAME

## Iteration 1

 * Start date: Thursday Oct 6th 2016
 * End date: FILL IN THE DATE WHEN YOU ARE PLANNING TO HAVE YOUR REVIEW MEETING

## Process


#### Roles & responsibilities

Initial Roles:
Dylan: Has the most front end experience in our team, so his role within the team
will be that of the designated front-end developer. In addition to writing the
front-end implementation, he will also be the individual that other members go to
when questions arise concerning the front-end.

Mack: In addition to being a general developer, Mack will be the primary quality
assurance specialist of the team. His task will be to go through the code to 
make sure that quality requirements are fulfilled.

Freddy: Will focus on gamification and level design. The primary goal of this 
project is education, but a large part of effective education is engagement; it is for 
this purpose that Freddy will be given the task of creating engaging and 
interesting level designs and game features.

Maria and Herman: Maria and Herman will be the dedicated developers for this 
project. Focusing mainly on the implementation of the project but occasionally 
moving into other areas if help is needed.


#### Events

	The current plan regarding events is to have, at minimum, one face-to-face meeting weekly and to make use
of Slack (a team communication application) on a consistent bases. If a face-to-face meeting is not 
possible then an online meeting can be held in the form of a group call. In general, the purpose of these 
meetings is to go over what has been done and assign general tasks to be completed by the next meeting time. 
The meetings will also be a knowledge sharing period where team members can help solve any issues of concern 
other members are having. Smaller decisions will be handled in the group chat over Slack.
 

#### Artifacts

	Our team will make use of several applications for team organization and task distribution. For team organization we will make use
of Slack(the team communications application); decisions made over Slack will likely be on topics not concerning direct implementation 
but more so on scheduling and other team issues. General brainstorming and info aggregation will be handled by the use of google docs. 
The group editing allowed by google docs will also assist during weekly meetings if we unable to meet face-to-face. for assigning tasks 
and tracking progress we will make use of a to-do list, primarily over the tool Trello. The Trello interface is composed of a project backlog, 
a blocked task list, an in-progress task list, tasks to be tested, tasks which are completed, and lastly tasks which have been merged and pushed.
The assignment of these tasks, and their associated priority, will be carried out during either the group meetings or over Slack.

## Product

Goals and tasks:

 * Describe your goals for this iteration and the tasks that you will have to complete in order to achieve these goals.
 * When listing goals/tasks, order the items from most to least important.
 * Feel free (but not obligated) to specify some/all tasks as user stories.

Artifacts

 * Describe the artifacts (diagrams, interactive mock-ups, wireframes, actual code, etc.)
   that you are planning to produce by the end of (and during) this iteration.
 * Be precise.
   For example: "Build the website" is not precise at all, but "Build a static home page and upload it somewhere, so that it is publicly accessible" is much clearer.
