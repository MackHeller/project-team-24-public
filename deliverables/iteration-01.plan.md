#### Roles & responsibilities TODO

Initial Roles
Dylan: Has most front end experience of all of us, so will focus on 
front-end but will do a bit of everything.

Mack: Weâ€™re all going to do QA, but Mack will check over it and make 
sure everything is standardized since he has industry experience with it.

Freddy: Will focus on gamification and level design. The goal is to 
try to make it more engaging and built pre-set puzzles for students to 
solve and learn concepts.

Maria and Herman: Focus on back-end.

## Product

Goals and tasks:

 * Describe your goals for this iteration and the tasks that you will have to complete in order to achieve these goals.
 * When listing goals/tasks, order the items from most to least important.
 * Feel free (but not obligated) to specify some/all tasks as user stories.

Artifacts

 * Describe the artifacts (diagrams, interactive mock-ups, wireframes, actual code, etc.)
   that you are planning to produce by the end of (and during) this iteration.
 * Be precise.
   For example: "Build the website" is not precise at all, but "Build a static home page and upload it somewhere, so that it is publicly accessible" is much clearer.
