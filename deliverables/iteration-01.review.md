# YOUR PRODUCT/TEAM NAME

## Iteration 1 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: FILL IN THE DATE WHEN YOU ACTUALLY HAD YOUR REVIEW MEETING
 * Where: PHYSICAL LOCATION AND/OR ONLINE
 
  Meeting 1:
  - Thursday Oct 6th 2016
  - The meeting took place in person in room 3200 BA.
  - The purpose of the meeting was to discuss our project options. Each group member put forward a
  list of ideas. We then analysed the positives and negatives or each idea (giving each one a final score).
  Please refer to Brainstorming Google Doc (link under Artifacts)
  
  Meeting 2:
  - Sunday Oct 16th 2016
  - The meeting took place over Google hangouts 
  - We finalised which problem we were going to solve. We discussed roles, 
  target audience, workflow, weekly tasked and initial blockers. Please refer
  to Idea Pitch in artifacts. 
  
  Meeting 3:
  - Sunday Oct 23th 2016 
  - The meeting took place over Google hangouts
  - We reviewed what we did this week. Discussed additional ways to organise ourselves,
  discussed goals for future weeks. 
   
  

## Process - Reflection

(Optional) Short introduction

Decisions turned out well:

 * List a few (2-5) decisions, from most to least important.
 * Support your argument (that a decisions was successful) by referring/linking to process artifact(s).
 
 We met most of our goals and produced all artifacts, overall went well.
 - Setting meetings: Got weekly meeting set up, doing well regardless of midterm week
 - Choosing an idea: Chose concrete idea out of our 15+ ideas
 - Creating slides: Presentation went well, got favorable reception from TA and audience. 


Decisions did not turn out as well as you hoped:

 * Once again, list a few (2 - 5) decisions, from most to least important.
 * As before, support your arguments by referring/linking to process artifacts.
 
 Set up fairly ambitious goals for this specific week considering itâ€™s midterm week
 - We still need to become more familiar with Unity as a group
 - We ended up not liking the decisions to use Gibhub Issues. We would rather have a tool 
  that lets us nest tasks. We are looking for other options currently. 

We are planning to make the following changes to our process:

 * List the changes you are planning to make, if any, from most to least important.
 * For each change, explain why you are making it by referring to a decision that didn't work well.
 
 Set some hard deadlines rather than just list priorities - 
 we need everyone to pick up Unity if we want to be able to move forward with dev. 
 An alternative product management tool that we are looking at is Trello. 


## Product - Review

Goals/tasks that were met/completed:

 * List goals/tasks, from most to least important.
 * If a goal/task was not part of the original iteration plan, please mention it.
 * For each goal/task, refer to artifact(s) that show that it was met/completed.
 
 - We have a concrete problem to solve (Google doc for brainstorming projects)
 - Very rough idea of implementation down and how our group will function. (initial idea pitch document)


Goals/tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

 * List goals/tasks, from most to least important.
 * For each goal/task, explain why it was not met/completed.
   e.g. Did you change your mind, or did you just not get to it yet?
   
   Having all group member trained in Unity 
   - Midterm week gave our group members very little additional time to learn Unity 


(Optional) Goals/tasks that were not originally planned, but ended up being not met/completed:

 * List goals/tasks, from most to least important.
 * For each goal/task, explain why you decided to change your plan and add this goal/task.


Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

 * List the few (2-5) high-level concepts that should guide your work for the next few weeks.
 * These concepts should help you prioritize features and decide on where to focus your efforts.
 
 - Aim for high-utility/low-tasks first
 - Set concrete deadlines for team to follow rather than just priorities
