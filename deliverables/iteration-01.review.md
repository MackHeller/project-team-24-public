# Logic Circuit Game

## Iteration 1 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: Sunday Oct 23rd 2016
 * Where: Online over Hangouts

### Summary of Meetings

#### Meeting 1
 * When: Thursday Oct 6th 2016
 * Where: In person in BA3200
 * What: The purpose of the meeting was to discuss our project ideas. Each group member put forward a list of ideas. We then analysed the positives and negatives of each idea (giving each one a score). We started our [Brainstormed Ideas artifact][brainstormed ideas] at this meeting.
  
#### Meeting 2
 * When: Sunday Oct 16th 2016
 * Where: Online over Hangouts
 * What: We finalised which problem we were going to solve. We discussed roles, target audience, workflow, weekly tasks and initial blockers. We started our [Idea Pitch artifact][idea pitch] at this meeting. 
  
#### Meeting 3
 * When: Sunday Oct 23th 2016 
 * Where: Online over Hangouts
 * What: We reviewed what we did this week. Discussed additional ways to organise ourselves, discussed goals for future weeks. 
   

## Process - Reflection

We met most of our goals and produced all artifacts, in general everything went well.

Decisions that turned out well:

 * Setting meetings: Got weekly meeting set up, everyone was able to meet even though we were busy with midterm week
 * Use of Slack: Slack has turned out to be excellent for coordinating meeting locations and times as well as general project related communication. We set up a GitHub integration in slack so we receive notifications of the progress everyone is making on our project.
 * Use of Google docs: Collaborating when creating our planned artifacts was really easy. It allowed us to rapidly brainstorm and iterate on our ideas and we were able to create excellent presentation slides that got favorable reception from TA and audience. 

Decisions that did not turn out as well as you hoped:

 * Set up fairly ambitious goals for this specific week considering itâ€™s midterm week
 * Our chosen project management tool (GitHub issues) turned out to be unsatisfactory

We are planning to make the following changes to our process:

 * Set hard deadlines rather than just list priorities
 * An alternative product management tool that we are looking at is Trello


## Product - Review

Goals/tasks that were met/completed:

 * We brainstormed plenty of ideas (See [Brainstormed Ideas artifact][brainstormed ideas])
 * We analysed each of our ideas and picked the best one (See [Idea Pitch artifact][idea pitch])
 * We created a Google slides presentation to pitch our idea in tutorial (See [Idea Pitch Presentation artifact][idea pitch presentation])
 * We got a rough idea for what we will use and how we will implement our project (See [Idea Pitch artifact][idea pitch])

Goals/tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

 * Getting all group members up to speed with Unity. Midterm week was quite restrictive on the time we could contribute to this.

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

 * Get our project set up so we can start working in Unity.
 * Implement a basic prototype that will allow us to:
   * Drag and drop built-in gates
   * Connect gates to each other
   * Test logic of the circuit

Product artifacts that we produced this iteration:
 * [Brainstormed Ideas][brainstormed ideas] - All of our brainstormed ideas
 * [Idea Pitch][idea pitch] - The idea we selected in more detail than in the brainstorming doc
 * [Idea Pitch Presentation][idea pitch presentation] - The presentation for pitching our chosen idea in tutorial
