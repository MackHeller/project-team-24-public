Thurs Nov 3 2016 - Fri Nov 11 2016
Drag and drop & Collision (Kailey and Maria)-	Can drag over other objects, canâ€™t place over them-	Need to allow wires to overlap but not gates-	Need to be able to detect if wire is connected (maybe simple click)-	Use placeholder game objects for now, Freddy will hook up later-	Be able to delete objectsAccounts (Mack)-	Probably use a DB for usernames, passwords, and a set of map IDs that they can edit and map IDs which they cannot or something more efficient of the sort to maintain permission-	Need to be able to log in and outWires and gates code implementation (Freddy)-	Writing code for levels, gates, wires (least rusty with csc258 here)-	Hook them onto game objects once Kailey and Maria finished drag & drop and collisionFront-end, mainly menus and UI right now (Dylan)-	Create UIs following the menu specifications from last meeting-	Try to find 3D game objects for the gates and wires (Unity store)?For Version control: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWCofZtnLlM
